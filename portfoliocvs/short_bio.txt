My name is Hassan Sidique Konneh, and I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With over three years of experience in International Development Cooperation as a Data Analyst, Data Management Specialist, and Private Sector Development Advisor, I have had the privilege of working on impactful projects that drive sustainable change. My journey has also taken me into the world of Geographic Information Systems, where I spent over a year as a specialist on a World Bank-funded project. I am a researcher, a software developer, a data specialist, and an AI enthusiast, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.

My professional journey has been diverse and rewarding. At GIZ, I have been deeply involved in project monitoring, data management, and private sector development, contributing to the economic empowerment of women and youth in Sierra Leone. My time at Statistics Sierra Leone provided me with a strong foundation in data quality management and GIS. I am proficient in a wide range of tools and technologies, and I am a firm believer in continuous learning. Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about giving back to my community, and I have volunteered as a digital soft skills trainer to empower women and youths with the skills they need to succeed in the digital age.

My life was truly transformed by the Orange Digital Center (ODC) coding school. The Full Stack Web and Mobile Development program was more than just an education; it was a gateway to a new world of possibilities. The ODC equipped me with the technical skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Flutter, and Dart that have become the bedrock of my career as a software developer and data specialist. But the impact of the ODC goes far beyond technical skills. It ignited a fire in me, a passion for innovation and a belief in my own potential. The ODC didn't just teach me to code; it taught me how to think, how to create, and how to solve problems. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity the Orange Digital Center gave me. It has empowered me to not only build a successful career but also to give back to my community as a volunteer trainer, sharing the knowledge and passion that the ODC instilled in me. The Orange Digital Center is not just a coding school; it is a beacon of hope and a catalyst for change in Sierra Leone, and I am a proud product of its vision.
