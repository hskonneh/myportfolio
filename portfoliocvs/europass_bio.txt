A professional with a strong work ethic with diverse experiences and skills applicable in different disciplines.

    With over three years in International Development Cooperation as a Data Analyst, Data Management Specialist and a Private Sector Development Advisor.
    Also, with over one year as a Geographic Information Systems Specialist in a World Bank funded Project in Household and census survey.
    I have also volunteered as a digital soft skills trainer to enhance the skills of women and youths in my community.
    A Tech enthusiast, that's a Researcher, software developer, a data specialist and an AI enthusiast.

Continuous learning and adaptation drive my approach to emerging technologies and methodologies—whether mastering the latest AI techniques, exploring new programming languages, or deepening my GIS expertise. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, immersing myself in new cultures and innovations, mentoring community members in digital skills, and recharging by the beach, where coastal retreats broaden my perspective and fuel creative problem-solving.
